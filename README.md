## About Me

I’m **Sebastião Santos Lessa**, based in Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹.

Professionally, I work as a **Generative AI Engineer**, building LLM based systems like conversational agents 💬, multi agent workflows 🧠🧩, and AI powered automation ⚙️🤖. A big part of my work lives in the world of **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** 🔎📚, from knowledge ingestion and embeddings to retrieval pipelines, prompt engineering, and evaluating grounded, reliable outputs in production.

Alongside GenAI, I also work on **data science and machine learning projects** 📊📈, covering the full journey from data exploration and modelling to deployment and monitoring in real systems.

### Scientific and Research Interests 🧪📚

From a scientific perspective, my academic focus is on **time series analysis and forecasting** ⏱️📉, which is also the core topic of my Master’s thesis. I’m especially interested in **foundation models for time series**, synthetic data generation, imputation, and modelling complex temporal behaviour in real world systems, with a strong focus on energy related domains ⚡.

I enjoy working where theory meets practice 🧠➡️🌍, using rigorous methods while keeping a clear focus on applicability and measurable impact.

### Research 📝🔬

I am the author of a **peer reviewed research paper**, presented at **IEEE PowerTech 2025** ⚡🎓, focused on the use of **foundation models for time series imputation in energy systems**.

## Terminal and Shell Theme

🖥️ For my command-line interface (CLI), I prefer using the [*hyper*](https://github.com/vercel/hyper) terminal with the *zsh* shell. It offers a great user experience and makes my development workflow more efficient. With the [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.



| Configurations:         | [hyper.js](.hyper.js) | [zshrc](.zshrc) | [p10k.zsh](.p10k.zsh) |
